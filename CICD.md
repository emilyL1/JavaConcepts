# CICD

- Continuous Integration - keep merging/pushing code so the build and test could be run regularly. 
- Continuous Delivery - keep the codebase in a ready state.
- Continuous Deployment - keep deploying the code.
    - Deployment is more focused on the process of releasing the product. Delivery is more about making sure the project is always ready for releasing.
